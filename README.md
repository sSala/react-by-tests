# React by tests
This project is created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

Learn React using the tests.

* [React](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) – Delightful JavaScript Testing
* [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) – Enzyme is a JavaScript Testing utility for React that makes it easier to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components' output.

Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.<br>
If something doesn’t work, please [file an issue](https://github.com/sSala/react-by-tests/issues/new).

## Quick Overview

```sh
npm start
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see your app.<br>
When you’re ready to deploy to production, create a minified bundle with `npm run build`.


### Get Started Immediately

You **don’t** need to install or configure tools like Webpack or Babel.<br>
They are preconfigured and hidden so that you can focus on the code.

Just create a project, and you’re good to go.

## Creating an App

**You’ll need to have Node >= 9.8.0 on your local development machine** You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm install` or `yarn install`

Install all packages.

### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.<br>
By default, runs tests related to files changed since the last commit.

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
By default, it also includes a service worker so that your app loads from local cache on future visits.

We are ready so let's start learning!!!
